üéØ Demonstrating Java Mastery: Essential Data Structures & Algorithms Implementation

### ‚ú® Highlights:
- This repository demonstrates a side project in which I've developed and implemented essential data structures and algorithms using generics, resulting in a clean, reusable, and efficient code. 
- These data structures can carry out operations on both built-in and custom data types, making them extremely versatile and useful in a wide range of programming contexts.
- Additionally, I've also improved the performance and efficiency of sorting, searching, and shortest-path algorithms.
- This repository is a fantastic resource for developers looking to improve their algorithmic abilities and apply efficient solutions to real-world situations.

### Features
- Generic Data Structures: Implementation of linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees that can handle various data types.
- Sorting Algorithms: Optimized algorithms for efficient sorting of data sets, including QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort.
- Searching Algorithms: Efficient searching algorithms like Binary Search and Depth-First Search (DFS) for quick data retrieval.
- Shortest-Path Solvers: Algorithms to find the shortest paths in graphs, including Dijkstra's, Floyd Warshall & Bellman Ford algorithms.
- Clean and Reusable Code: The codebase is well-structured and designed to be easily reusable and extensible.
